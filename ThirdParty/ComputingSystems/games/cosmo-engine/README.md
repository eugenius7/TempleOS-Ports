# cosmo-engine

Port of [cosmo-engine](https://github.com/yuv422/cosmo-engine) to TempleOS

![cosmo-engine](https://gitlab.com/obecebo/cosmo-engine/-/raw/master/screenshot.png "cosmo-engine")

This is a work in progress and a lot of things are broken/need to be implemented properly (such as Events, i.e. "Press Any Key" only responds to ESC at the moment).

# Usage

Clone the repo, create a RedSea `ISO.C` image with the repo files and the game assets, `#include "Run";`

# Controls

MOVE/LOOK: `ARROW KEYS`

JUMP: `CTRL`

DROP BOMBS: `ALT` 

# TODO

- Menus
- Ending sequence
- A lot of other things
