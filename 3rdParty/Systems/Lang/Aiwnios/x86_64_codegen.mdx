# Welcome to the shitty-est codegen on earth Motherfucker.

This `X86-64` is a peice of shit code generator for this compiler.
At the core of this backend is is `CICArg`s. They contain information about 
what an `CRPN` is going to do. What is a fucking `CRPN`,ill explain below:

## What the Fuck is a `CRPN`

A `CRPN` means **R**everse **P**olish **N**otation. If you are too lazy to read
this look at this pretty picture

Basically the `CRPN` is a linked list of stack items. These motherfuckers each
take a fixed length of arguments,so constructing a "tree" is pretty easy.

`(1 +a 2)+(2+4)` would look like this in `CRPN`:

```
                 ((1+2)+(2+4))
(1+2)     (2+4)   |
1 2 +     2 4 +   +
```
As you can see the operators come after the operands. They `CRPN`s are not
stored as a tree but a list. Let's continue to the intricaices of the `CICArg`s

## `CICArg`s and Shit
Im going to cut the the chase,im assuming you know stuff about assembly. All of the 
`CICArg.mode`s are basically addressing modes. These are stored in the `CRPN.res` member.
The arguments are stored in the `ICArgN(rpn,n)->res` member of a `CRPN`.
**ICArgN TAKES REVERSE POLISH NOTATION SO THE LAST ARGUMENT IS THE "FIRST"**

Luckily for you,a function called `PushTmpDepthFirst`. The reason this is called
`PushTmpDepthFirst` is becuase of the stack like nature of the `CRPN`s. This function keeps a 
"virtual" stack that is translated into registers and stack addresses

This works in a **DEPTH FIRST** manner so that the leaves on the "tree" get the registers
(There are a lot more leaves on the tree than registers)

Internally used by  `PushTmpDepthFirst` are `PushTmp` and `PushSpilledTmp`.
 - `PushTmp` will automatically push registers or if none are avialbe,it will spill to the stack frame
 - `PushSpilledTmp` will spill the value to the stack always,even if registers are avaible(sometimes function calls will destroy registers)

There are pesky things about some of the `CRPN`s that may get in the,such as function calls spilling the temporary registers
You can check if a RPN spills temporary registers with `SpillsTmpRegs`. And you can trigger spilling with
`PushTmpDepthFirst(CCmpCtrl *,CRPN *,spill_regs,unused)`(argument 3).

Always const the `__OptPassFinal` implementation of the `IC_xxx` as the canonical way to
assign ICArgs

### `CICArg`  RULES
**FUCKING READ THIS SECTION IF ANYTHING**. During `__OptPassFinal`. Sometimes you need to assign
